# AMC-Java-Assignments
Assignments that I've done for the Software Development course during my time studying for my BSc on AMC (In cooperation with the University of East London) - Some of these were made as a practice

I am aware that some of these are not perfect or the approach taken might not be quite the right one but please do note that I do not plan on correcting/doing any changes on all of them.
Thank you for your time and I will kindly accept any comments that aim to help me improve in general
